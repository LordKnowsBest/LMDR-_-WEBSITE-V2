## Context

Tim connected with Levy Rivers via LinkedIn through the PAEN network. Initial exchange happened several weeks prior to 2026-02-24. Tim offered to make introductions given his experience and network in Indianapolis. Levy has not yet responded.

**Levy's note on the relationship:**
> "I want to build a relationship. He's from PAEN. He has a background in logistics — more procurement, manufacturing procurement. Understands the logistical perspective. This should be a brick in a building, a point in the arc of a story."

## Outreach Strategy

**What Tim can do for VelocityMatch:**
- Introductions to Indianapolis-area logistics and transportation operators
- Warm path into manufacturing companies with private fleet / carrier relationships
- PAEN peer validation — fellow founders respect warm intros from within the network

**Indianapolis targets identified (2026-02-24 session):**
- **ProTrans** — HQ Indianapolis, 24 service centers across US/Canada/Mexico, high driver churn, regionally powerful 3PL
- **Venture Logistics** — HQ Indianapolis, tech-forward fleet operator
- **Buske Logistics**, **MD Logistics**, **Hanzo Logistics** — regional 3PLs
- **Eli Lilly logistics/distribution arm** — massive footprint, manufacturing procurement adjacent
- **Allison Transmission** — automotive manufacturer, logistics procurement connections
- **ASCM Central Indiana** — supply chain professional association, speaking/intro pipeline

**Analogy that lands with Tim specifically:**
> "What procurement automation did for manufacturer sourcing — that's what VelocityMatch is doing for how carriers acquire CDL drivers."

**What we actually place — job types Tim can speak to:**

These are the roles VelocityMatch recruits for. Knowing this lets Tim (or anyone he introduces us to) immediately map us to their open positions.

| Driver Type | Description | Who hires in Indy |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Class A CDL — OTR** | Long-haul, multi-state routes, 5–14 day cycles | ProTrans, Venture Logistics, regional carriers |
| **Class A CDL — Regional** | Home weekly, 500–800mi radius, highest demand category | ProTrans, Buske, MD Logistics |
| **Class A CDL — Dedicated** | Fixed route, fixed customer, predictable schedule | Manufacturing fleet arms (Eli Lilly, Allison) |
| **Class A CDL — Flatbed** | Open-deck freight, steel, equipment, construction materials | Manufacturing/industrial suppliers |
| **Class A CDL — Tanker** | Liquid/gas bulk transport, hazmat endorsement common | Chemical, pharma, fuel distributors |
| **Class B CDL — Local/City** | Straight trucks, urban delivery, home daily | Distribution centers, last-mile operations |
| **Owner-Operator / Lease-Op** | Independent contractor, own equipment | Asset-light carriers, brokers, spot freight |
| **Team Drivers** | Two-driver teams, maximum miles, time-sensitive freight | National freight lanes, time-definite 3PLs |
| **Hazmat Endorsement** | Any class, HAZMAT certification required | Pharma (Eli Lilly distribution), chemical, fuel |
| **Intermodal / Drayage** | Port and rail yard moves, container transport | Logistics hubs, ProTrans intermodal ops |

**The shortage reality Tim should know:**
The industry is short ~80,000 CDL drivers now. Projected to reach 160,000 by 2030. Every carrier on that Indianapolis target list is actively struggling with this. This isn't a nice-to-have product — it's infrastructure for a crisis.

## Draft Response — Version 2 (2026-02-24)

*Incorporates SDAP framing, casual tone, specific company bait, agentic sizzle. No call ask yet.*

> Tim — late reply, no excuse. Heads down building.
>
> Quick update: moved our first carrier into a paid pilot. It's the service phase of what becomes a platform — same pattern procurement automation followed when it disrupted manufacturer sourcing. We're applying it to how carriers find and acquire CDL drivers.
>
> The piece catching attention on the AI side: we've built autonomous recruiting loops. Driver-facing AI that qualifies candidates, carrier-facing AI that manages outreach. Full cycle. No recruiter in the middle. It's what everyone's writing about in AI right now — we're just running it where nobody has yet.
>
> I'm circling ProTrans and Venture Logistics in Indy specifically. If there's a thread to pull there, I'd put it to good use.

## Notes on Relationship Arc

- **Do not over-ask early.** Tim offered introductions — let him deliver on that before layering more asks.
- **Next natural step after introductions:** If Tim makes a warm intro to ProTrans or Venture, follow up and loop Tim in on the outcome. That builds the relationship.
- **Medium-term:** If Tim is genuinely engaged, consider inviting him to an advisory or ambassador role — his procurement/logistics credibility + Indianapolis roots = exactly the kind of industry validation VelocityMatch needs in fundraising conversations.
- **Long-term:** PAEN network could become a carrier acquisition channel (Purdue alumni in fleet management, logistics ops, supply chain are distributed across every major Indy employer).
