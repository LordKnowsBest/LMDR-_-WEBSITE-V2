# Plan — Agentic Orchestration (Cross-Role)

## Phase 1 — Foundation Hardening
- Build policy-tagged Tool Registry for all agent-callable functions.
- Add AgentRun/AgentStep persistence and correlation IDs.
- Resolve direct voice-to-tool execution path.
- Add one end-to-end test flow per role.

## Phase 2 — Cross-Role Intelligence Mesh
- Standardize carrier intelligence ingest (spot, capacity, disruption).
- Expose shared features to recruiter scoring and campaign automation.
- Add admin observability dashboards for run-level outcomes.

## Phase 3 — Recursive Compendium
- Create Compendium root and role indexes.
- Implement curator agent to write pattern/postmortem updates.
- Implement file sharding + index refresh when thresholds are exceeded.

## Phase 4 — Autonomous Operations
- Recruiter autopilot with approval gates.
- Admin self-healing runbooks with verification checks.
- Development swarm for audits and PR suggestions.

## Exit Criteria
- 80% low-risk workflow automation.
- 100% high-risk actions approval-gated.
- Compendium freshness SLA met for all role indexes.
