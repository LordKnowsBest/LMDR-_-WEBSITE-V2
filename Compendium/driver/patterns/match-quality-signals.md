# Match Quality Signals

> Confidence: high | Source: manual | Last validated: 2026-02-18

## Context

The AI matching engine scores driver-carrier compatibility across six weighted dimensions. Understanding which signals drive match quality allows the platform to surface better matches and give drivers actionable "Why You Matched" explanations via `matchExplanationService.jsw`.

## Details

- **Six scoring dimensions and weights:**
  - Qualifications (30%): CDL class, endorsements (Hazmat, Tanker, Doubles/Triples), clean MVR status, years of experience thresholds
  - Experience (20%): Total years driving, specific freight type experience, equipment familiarity
  - Location (20%): Proximity to carrier terminals or lane origin points, willingness to relocate
  - Availability (15%): Start date alignment, schedule preferences (OTR vs regional vs dedicated)
  - Salary Fit (15%): Driver's expected CPM vs carrier's offered CPM range, sign-on bonus weight
  - Engagement (bonus): Not a fixed percentage -- acts as a multiplier based on platform activity

- **Mutual match boost:** When a driver has expressed interest in a specific carrier (via the interest tracking system), the match score receives a +10 point bonus. This rewards proactive engagement from both sides.

- **Engagement score breakdown:** Recency of last login or profile update (50%), profile completeness percentage (30%), historical response rate to recruiter outreach (20%). Engagement decays: a driver inactive for 30+ days receives diminishing engagement bonuses.

- **Compensation alignment:** The salary fit dimension compares the driver's stated CPM expectations against the carrier's posted range. Exact matches score 100%; partial overlaps scale linearly; no overlap scores 0%.

- **Disqualifiers:** Certain mismatches produce a hard zero regardless of other scores: wrong CDL class, missing required endorsements, or unacceptable MVR violations. These are checked before the weighted scoring runs.

## Evidence

- Scoring logic implemented in `driverScoring.js` with weights defined as constants
- Match explanation generated by `matchExplanationService.jsw` method `getMatchExplanationForDriver(driverId, carrierDot)`
- Driver interest tracking in `v2_Driver Carrier Interests` table feeds the mutual match boost
- Carrier preferences stored in `v2_Carrier Job Preferences` used as the target for scoring
