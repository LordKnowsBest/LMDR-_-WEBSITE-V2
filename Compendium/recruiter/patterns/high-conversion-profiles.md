# High-Conversion Profiles

> Confidence: medium | Source: observation | Last validated: 2026-02-18

## Context

Certain driver profile characteristics correlate with higher funnel conversion rates. Identifying these patterns allows recruiters to prioritize outreach and allocate effort toward leads most likely to reach HIRED status.

## Details

- **Profile completeness matters:** Drivers with 80%+ profile completion convert at significantly higher rates. Incomplete profiles stall at SCREENING because recruiters lack the data to advance them.
- **Endorsement alignment:** Drivers whose CDL endorsements (Hazmat, Tanker, Doubles/Triples) match the carrier's freight type convert faster through APPLICATION and INTERVIEW stages.
- **Home time preference match:** The single strongest predictor of offer acceptance is alignment between the driver's stated home time preference and the carrier's actual home time policy.
- **Recency signal:** Drivers who updated their profile or engaged with the platform within the last 7 days are 3x more likely to respond to outreach than dormant profiles.
- **CPM expectations:** Drivers whose expected cents-per-mile falls within the carrier's posted range (not above) progress through the funnel without salary negotiation stalls.

## Evidence

- Driver scoring uses 6 dimensions: qualifications (30%), experience (20%), location (20%), availability (15%), salary fit (15%), engagement (bonus)
- Engagement score formula: recency (50%) + profile completeness (30%) + response rate (20%)
- Mutual match boost: +10 points when driver has expressed interest in the carrier
- Analytics tracked via `v2_Recruiter Analytics` and `v2_Recruiter Funnel Metrics` tables
